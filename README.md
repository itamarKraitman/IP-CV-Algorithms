# Image Processing and Computer Vision Algorithms || Itamar Kraitman || 2022

### This repository contains four mini projects, where in each I implemented several IP and CV algorithms in different scale of dificulity. 
### Project 1
Algorithms which I implemented in this project:
* Reading an image, and converts it as requested to gray scale or RGB.
* Converting an RGB image to YIQ color space, and the oposite.
* Histogram equalization.
* Quantization.
### Project 2
Algorithms which I implemented in this project:
* Calculating gradient of an image.
* Bluting an image using gaussian kernel.
* Detecting edges using Zero-Crossing-LOG algorithm.
* Hough circle- detecting circles in image using Hough.
* Filtering an imgae using bilateral filter.
### Project 3:
Algorithms which I implemented in this project:
* Computing the translation between two images (optical flow) using Luckas Kanade.
* Computing the translation between two images using Luckas Kanade and Pyramids.
* Fidnding the translation and rigid matrices between two images using Luckas Kanade.
* Finding the translation and rigid metrics between two images using correlation.
* Warping an image acording to a given rigid matrix.
* Building gaussian pyramids.
* Building laplacian pyramids.
* Blending two images using pyramids.
### Project 4:
Algorithms which I implemented in this project:
* Computing disparity map of two images using SSD.
* Computing disparity map of two images using NCC.
* Computing homography- finding the hompgraphy matrix between two images.
* Warping two images interactively- Displays both images, and lets the user mark 4 or more points on each image.
Then calculates the homography and transforms the source image on to the destination image.
Then transforms the source image onto the destination image and displays the result.
